Automatic number-plate recognition is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and read vehicle registration plates from images. It combines Python, OpenCV, and machine learning techniques for efficient image processing. ANPR is widely used in automation, security, and traffic management systems.
